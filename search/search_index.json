In any sort of flow you will base the action on the policy name. In this case the partial offboarding event would cause maybe one of two actions, first might be to notify the correct people that there is an issue that needs their attention. The second option would be to attempt to disable the user account within Ping One as indicated should be done in the JSON.   - Recommendation and Description are really just useful display fields to help human beings understand what is going on.   - URL provides the ability to point back into your Authomize tenant and accesss the incident directly so other activities such as open and close of the incident can be performed.</p>"},{"location":"authomize/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>So what is needed, as indicated before you will need a token to access the API stack within Authomize.

This means that you can just request the email once and use the login scan to confirm it, without the need to send information or requests to the user's email. Once confirmed, you just save the information and let the user in.</p> <p>This method is secure on any public (or private) computer and browser because - even if the computer is compromised - the only information that is exposed is the user email, while the hashes and session information are delivered securely and directly to your connector.</p>"},{"location":"circleaccess/#capabilities","title":"Capabilities","text":""},{"location":"circleaccess/#authentication-initializeauthorizationrequest","title":"Authentication (initializeAuthorizationRequest)","text":"<p>Authentication using Circle Access</p>"},{"location":"circleaccess/#app-key-textfield","title":"App Key <code>textField</code>","text":"<p>App Key</p>"},{"location":"circleaccess/#read-key-textfield","title":"Read Key <code>textField</code>","text":"<p>Read Key</p>"},{"location":"circleaccess/#write-key-textfield","title":"Write Key <code>textField</code>","text":"<p>Write key</p>"},{"location":"circleaccess/#login-url-textfield","title":"Login Url <code>textField</code>","text":"<p>The URL of your Circle Access login</p>"},{"location":"clear/","title":"CLEAR Connector","text":""},{"location":"clear/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>CLEAR is a secure identity verification platform that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify users.

Here are descriptions of the parameters you can provide to the connector:</p> <ul> <li>Phone Number: Required. This field is prepopulated. It is the phone number of your end user (customer or applicant). Prefix the phone number with a plus sign, for example, +1. Do not include separators.</li> <li>Redirect URL: A redirect can occur at the completion of the capture process. For example, this redirect URL could load your company's webpage into the end user's browser. Use HTTPS in the URL with a fully qualified domain. </li> <li>Error Redirect URL: An error redirect can occur if the end user does not complete the capture process, for example, if the end user declines camera access. Another example is if the end user does not complete the capture process in time, as defined by the time-to-live (TTL) parameter. After an error, this URL loads in the browser, redirecting the end user. Use HTTPS in the URL with a fully qualified domain.</li> <li>TTL: Time-to-live, also known as the timeout value. Values are in minutes. The default is 10 minutes. The maximum is 30 minutes. IMPORTANT: Ensure that this TTL value matches the Poll Interval in the DaVinci polling component, which is part of the templated Intellicheck flow.</li> <li> <p>Document Type. Required.

You can select one Document Type per transaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Driver\u2019s License: Select this for a North American driver's license, including REAL ID, enhanced ID, learner permit, US military ID, and non-driver state identity card. This can include the United States, Canada, and Mexico identification.</p> </li> <li>Passport: Select this for a passport booklet or visa.</li> <li>Other: Select this for an international passport card, a trusted traveler card, or a permanent resident card. </li> <li>Device Validation: If toggled off (default), no device validation results are returned. If toggled on, device validation results are returned. Device validation includes customer quality checks such as device fingerprint, IP address, and phone validation.</li> <li> <p>Signals: Required. Signals are the distinct validation checks to be performed. Each signal represents one check. Select one or more signals to customize an identity verification workflow. Signals and document types share some dependencies. You must understand which ones go together. See Document Types and Signals. If you select more than one signal, only certain combinations are allowed. See Multi-Signal Requests for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>ID Check: Barcode analysis on North American driver's licenses, including real IDs and extended IDs.</p> </li> <li>Document Liveness: Document probability checks for on-screen presentation, printed copy, and portrait substitution.</li> <li>OCR Scan: OCR scan on passport books, passport cards, and other forms of identification.</li> <li>OCR Match: Compare the OCR scan to the barcode or MRZ data.</li> <li>Selfie: Facial matching and liveness.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"intellicheck/#connector-settings","title":"Connector Settings","text":""},{"location":"intellicheck/#configuration-settings","title":"Configuration Settings","text":"<p>The Intellicheck connector requires three bits of information to configure: * Base URL: Base URL from your Intellicheck tenant.

With iProov it\u2019s easy for organizations to create fully customized flows, without requiring users to jump through frustrating hoops or exposing them to social engineering and phishing. With robust device support, deepfake protection and flexible service levels based on use case, organization risk appetite, and level of identity assurance, we enable you to securely authenticate customers and workers anywhere, on any device, and in any flow.</p>"},{"location":"iproov/#setup","title":"Setup","text":""},{"location":"iproov/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>To use the connector, you'll need:</p> <ul> <li>iProov Tenant: The iProov tenant URL.

authentication that does not require user action within the PingOne DaVinci flow. </p> <p>MagicEndpoint is based on the principle that the endpoint can perform public key-based authentication that no other device or bad actor can duplicate. Leveraging this inherent capability within endpoint devices significantly reduces the attack surface. The breakthrough behind MagicEndpoint's technology means a client only has to authenticate to the endpoint to verify they are in possession of the device, and the endpoint can do the remote authentication on behalf of the user, with no user action required. MagicEndpoint does not need phones or external tokens. Smarter, faster passwordless authentication means no more obtaining codes from mobile devices, or accepting insecure \"push\" notifications, or re-setting multiple passwords. </p> <p>The result? With the MagicEndpoint connector, CIOs and CISOs can be confident their employees and data are protected while reducing and eventually eliminating the need for password support.</p>"},{"location":"winmagic/#setup","title":"Setup","text":""},{"location":"winmagic/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>In DaVinci, add a MagicEndpoint connection in the flow when authentication is required.</p> <p>Configure MagicEndpoint IdP OIDC Service Providers: * How to configure MagicEndpoint IdP OIDC Service Providers</p> <p>MagicEndpoint IdP: * MagicEndpoint Enterprise Authentication</p>"},{"location":"winmagic/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>To use the connector, you\u2019ll need:</p> <ol> <li>SecureDoc Enterprise Server and MagicEndpoint IdP installed</li> <li>A MagicEndpoint license</li> <li>MagicEndpoint Windows Client installed on the endpoint </li> <li>MagicEndpoint Authenticator (for Out of Band Support) on mobile devices (iOS and Android)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"winmagic/#setting-up-magicendpoint-idp","title":"Setting up MagicEndpoint IdP","text":"<ol> <li>Obtain MagicEndpoint \u2013 OIDC URL settings:</li> </ol> <p>Admin can login to MagicEndpoint IdP web portal and obtain OIDC URLs from Configuration -&gt; OIDC </p> <ol> <li>Add Service Provider \u2013 PingOne: </li> <li>Admin can add an OIDC service provider by clicking on \"+ Add Service Provider\" on Configuration -&gt; OIDC</li> <li>Service Provider (SP) Name: PingOne</li> <li>Client Name: PingOne</li> <li>Redirect URL: Obtain from PingOne console</li> <li>Client Secret: * Enter a new secret *</li> <li>Session exp.
