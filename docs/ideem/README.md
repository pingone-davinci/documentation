# Ideem Connector

# Introduction

The Ideem connector for PingOne DaVinci enables secure device trust validation using Ideem's patented ZSM (Zero-Trust Secure Module) technology. It renders a browser-based profiling screen, initiates a lightweight device authentication event, and validates the resulting token on the backend.

# Setup

## Resources

For developer documentation and API credentials, please contact an Ideem representative.

- [Ideem](https://useideem.com)

## Requirements

To use the Ideem connector, the following are required:

- **Application ID**: Your unique application ID from Ideem.
- **ZSM Client SDK API Key**: Used in the frontend Pingjection script for device profiling.
- **Validate Token API Key**: Used to authorize the backend token validation request.
- **Ideem Host URL**: The base URL of your Ideem environment.
- **Application Environment**: The Ideem application environment name.
- **User Identifier**: The unique user ID or email address used to bind and validate the device.

## Setting up the connector

- Navigate to the Ideem connector's general configuration in PingOne DaVinci.
- Provide the required credentials:
  - **Application ID**
  - **ZSM Client SDK API Key**
  - **Validate Token API Key**
  - **Host URL**
  - **Application Environment**
  - **User Identifier**
- Optionally configure:
  - **Company Logo** and **Company Name**: Displayed in the UI branding.
  - **Polling Screen Delay (ms)**: Controls how long to wait before auto-submitting the form.
  - **Polling Text**: Displayed to the user during token validation.

# Using the connector in a flow

After setup, you can use the Ideem connector in a flow to:

- Render a custom UI screen for browser-based device profiling using Pingjection.
- Automatically validate the resulting token against the Ideem backend.
- Return a signed device trust token and user metadata back into the flow.

## Capabilities

### Validate Device Token

This capability renders a custom UI and initiates browser-based profiling. After a signed token is generated by the ZSM module, it is validated via a secure backend call.

Output Schema:
```
